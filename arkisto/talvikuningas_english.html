<p class="p1"><b>THE WINTER KING</b></p>
<p class="p3"><i>(Lyrics by A.W.Yrj&auml;n&auml; translation by Ville Moilanen)</i></p>
<p class="p5"><i>"In 2727 A.D. the good eparch Wong Wu-Wei, whose name means He Who Is Not, gave a garden as a morning gift to his wife. The whole garden would fit into the nail of her little finger. The eparch had built babbling brooks, arched bridges and stunning waterfalls, selected and planted innumerable different blooming trees and built a thousand mechanical birds to sit on their branches. Each of them could sing, in many languages, pieces of the Saga of the Winter King."</i></p>
<p class="p6"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>I | The Almighty</b></p>
<p class="p1">Laertes Prime A.D. 2481, Autumnal Equinox</p>
<p class="p7">The sky is turning red, it knows what to expect</p>
<p class="p7">As the bows of ships are glowing at the docking stations.</p>
<p class="p7">They rest like wounded animals, so tired</p>
<p class="p7">The encircled city awakens in the morning of her last day.</p>
<p class="p7">Soon, from the night of ages would the spectres of winged bulls march</p>
<p class="p7">From the night of the mist of antiquity, from the dusk of nightmares.</p>
<p class="p7">Soon the heavens would open, herds of angels would surge</p>
<p class="p8">With arms full of lightning bolts, eyes radiating justice</p>
<p class="p7">The king leans on his golden hand in the depths of his tower of metal.</p>
<p class="p7">Like a solar flare his stare is soulless, pale, ever-burning.</p>
<p class="p7">Now, on the day of defeat, before the doom, he is looking down on his kingdom</p>
<p class="p7">And with a face of stone he quotes an old story to the empty walls:</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p7"><i>Beyond the wall of light, beyond the reach of speed:</i></p>
<p class="p7"><i><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>There lie the smoking mirrors above the cosmos</i></p>
<p class="p7"><i>Beyond the wall of light, beyond the reach of speed:</i></p>
<p class="p8"><i><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>There lies the emptiness that binds us together</i></p>

<p class="p7"><i>Beyond the wall of light, beyond the reach of speed:</i></p>
<p class="p7"><i><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>There lie the smoking mirrors above the cosmos</i></p>
<p class="p7"><i>Beyond the wall of light, beyond the reach of speed:</i></p>
<p class="p7"><i><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>There lies the emptiness that binds us together</i></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p7">Air ripples in the room and shadows are moving in the hallways</p>
<p class="p7">A shape is gleaming in the dark, even the silence goes silent.</p>
<p class="p7">On the general frequency voices clang at last</p>
<p class="p7">and they talk like the voice of an ultimate winner:</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p7">"You were the king of worlds, holding their strings.</p>
<p class="p7">You were a ruler: by your will would lives end or be spared.</p>
<p class="p7">At the end of the day even a king is weak just like anyone else.</p>
<p class="p7">You shall yet fall on your face and wish to save every last one."</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p7">Is the world limited, are we its prisoners?</p>
<p class="p7">Then there is a god is behind it all.</p>
<p class="p7">Or limitless, without boundaries: then we are alone, free...</p>
<p class="p7">But what to do when one knows that the story is about to end?</p>
<p class="p7">Be wise, give me a standing place</p>
<p class="p7">And I will crank the world off its hinges.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p7"><i>Beyond the wall of light, beyond the reach of speed:</i></p>
<p class="p7"><i><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>There lie the memories that build us</i></p>
<p class="p7"><i>Beyond the wall of light, beyond the reach of speed:</i></p>
<p class="p7"><i><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>There lies the time that prepares us for this moment</i></p>
<p class="p2"><i></i><br></p>
<p class="p7"><i>Beyond the wall of light, beyond the reach of speed:</i></p>
<p class="p7"><i><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>There lie the smoking mirrors above the cosmos</i></p>
<p class="p7"><i>Beyond the wall of light, beyond the reach of speed:</i></p>
<p class="p7"><i><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>There lies the emptiness that binds us together</i></p>

<p class="p7">"My grave is guarded by a gentle breeze</p>
<p class="p7">My grave is guarded by a drop of morning dew</p>
<p class="p7">My grave is guarded by a hundred thousand killer satellites</p>
<p class="p7">My grave is guarded by a teraton of antimatter."</p>

<p class="p7">My helplessness calms me down quickly, I am trying my senses</p>
<p class="p7">I am looking for something in my memory, it is so desolate and empty</p>

<p class="p7">And the shadowy paths and the deserts</p>

<p class="p7"><i>But one does come, he escapes through the tunnel of a thousand fires</i></p>
<p class="p7"><i>Through shafts of time and the vortex of forces</i></p>
<p class="p7"><i>And finally wakes up in his ship</i></p>
<p class="p7"><i>He brings his ship down like a flaming arrow to the safety of the wilderness</i></p>
<p class="p7"><i>He escapes far from the route of his hunters</i></p>
<p class="p7"><i>And begins his longest journey</i></p>
<p class="p7"><i>He hears of an ageless woman up on the mountains, a madwoman or a seer</i></p>

<p class="p7">Winds and clouds were our people</p>
<p class="p7">When proud ideas carried us</p>
<p class="p7">And the deep flows of secrets.</p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p7"><i>Beyond the wall of light</i></p>
<p class="p7"><i>Beyond the reach of speed</i></p>
<p class="p7"><i>Lies the emptiness that binds us together.</i></p>
<p class="p7"><i>The grey rooms of reality</i></p>
<p class="p7"><i>Abandoned farms and roads of iron</i></p>
<p class="p7"><i>All the coldness that can hunt us down.</i></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p7">Spring, out there somewhere</p>
<p class="p7">You feel the heavy rumble of water.</p>
<p class="p7">You wait for the colours and the scents to return</p>
<p class="p7">You walk across the yard with a harsh mind.</p>
<p class="p7">But spring will not utter a word</p>
<p class="p7">Myrtles and laurels fall off to yesterday.</p>
<p class="p7">You think about the end of everything</p>
<p class="p7">About the autumn and the dark distances.</p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p7"><i>Above the gate of the wall of light</i></p>
<p class="p7"><i>A face pressed into metal</i></p>
<p class="p7"><i>It looks infinitely calm.</i></p>
<p class="p7"><i>In its bronze stare</i></p>
<p class="p7"><i>That is unchanging, unfamiliar</i></p>
<p class="p7"><i>There is all the horror that goes on and on.</i></p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p7">But it is all a dream, only a dream</p>
<p class="p7">Everything is a dream here, far away</p>
<p class="p7">Beyond all consolation</p>
<p class="p7">Expelled from the shores of beauty</p>
<p class="p7">But it is all a dream, only a dream</p>
<p class="p7">Everything is a dream here, far away</p>
<p class="p7">Beyond all consolation</p>
<p class="p7">Expelled from the shores of beauty</p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p7"><i>And so, when the elders of the council</i></p>
<p class="p7"><i>Wanted to submit me to the test</i></p>
<p class="p7"><i>I accepted the mission and disappeared</i></p>
<p class="p7"><i>On the deck of their most beautiful ship</i></p>

<p class="p7">Over the commands and shouts in the radio traffic</p>

<p class="p7">Could only be seen as dots on the tactical display.</p>
<p class="p7">I would only need one second, and I would remember</p>
<p class="p7">Why we were created, why we have come here</p>
<p class="p7">But a second in the midst of the roar of the battle</p>
<p class="p7">Is a small and impossible luxury</p>
<p class="p7">From the night of the emptiness, through its flames</p>
<p class="p7">My forehead is hit by an EMP</p>

<p class="p7"><i>The second memory, faltering like a grey, grainy picture</i></p>

<p class="p7"><i>As if something familiar, safe, long ago lost.</i></p>
<p class="p7"><i>It says that the body is a map and the pain is a compass</i></p>

<p class="p7">Systems crumble down, great words die on lips</p>
<p class="p7">And within the ruins, only a lonely breeze is wandering</p>
<p class="p7">And even though I live, everything is scattered in time</p>
<p class="p7">Blown to the solar winds of suns that will once die.</p>
<p class="p7">The mind's sphere of power is learning the message of space</p>
<p class="p7">And the silence of the wordless vaults of stars.</p>
<p class="p7">Did love, did hate once flow through my being</p>
<p class="p7">Life as its fabric, me as its thread</p>
